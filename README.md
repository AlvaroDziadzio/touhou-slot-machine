# Touhou Slot Machinne

This is my version of [Touhou Slot Machine](https://maribelhearn.com/slots). I like Touhou Project and found the original site pretty fun, so I decided to make my version of it.

I'm currently using the assets from the original site.


## Using

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then build an optimized version and run

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

*It usually takes around 40 seconds for the first build to complete*

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and it should be there.
